	abstract = {Construction risk can be described as the possibility of an incident that will harm the project's feasibility. Different threats that impact businesses may be found in the construction industry as elsewhere. Moreover, construction projects face significant risks, which put building projects at the risk of cost, over time, and poor standard of execution. However, in the last two years, Lebanon has been suffering from a severe economic crisis, which has affected various numbers of businesses and industries, specifically the construction industry. Therefore, this article is carried out to identify, classify and analyse the most significant risks inherent in the Lebanese construction industry with special emphasis on the financial and economic risk category and eventually establish a conclusion in this regard. To achieve the aims of this research, the data was collected by conducting a questionnaire survey among experts in the Lebanese construction industry. The results showed that the construction industry in Lebanon is exposed to many risk sources, internal and external and the most important are the financial risk such as fluctuation of the currency, inflation, lack of solvency, etc. Finally, the importance and benefits of implementing risk management are discussed in this research as well as the barriers to its effective implementation.},

However, this duty is particularly complex and inefficient if good risk management has not been done from the beginning of the project. An effective and efficient risk management approach requires a proper and systematic methodology and, more importantly, knowledge and experience. Previous research results in Chile have shown that both, owners and contractors do not systematically apply risk management practices, resulting in negative consequences for projects’ performance. This paper addresses the problems of risk management in construction projects using a knowledge-based approach, and proposes a methodology based on a three-fold arrangement that includes the modeling of the risk management function, its evaluation, and the availability of a best practices model. This approach is part of a * research effort that is underway. A major preliminary conclusion of this research is the fact that risk management in construction projects is still very ineffective and that the main cause of this situation is the lack of knowledge. It is expected that the application of the proposed approach will allow clients and contractors to develop a project's risk management function based on best practices, and also to improve the performance of this function.},

            The infrastructural and economic development of a country merely depends on the construction industry and its growth. There are many risk factors involved with the construction industry during planning, execution and commissioning of the projects. Dealing with the risk factors in construction industry have been known as a crucial management process in order to achieve the overall objectives of the industry in terms of cost, time, safety, quality and environmental sustainability. This report is related with the financial aspects which directly take part in the industry for which studies have been conducted with various engineers, contractors and labors in and around north-western districts of Tamilnadu. The perspectives at different levels of management have been concluded with the standard questionnaire format that has been investigated and their results are analyzed based on the current scenario. With the help of these surveys and data analysis by Relative Importance Index (RII), the most related factors among the identified factors were found to be labour risk, material risk, credit risk, planning risk, execution and environmental related factors. The suggestions and recommendations have been expressed to overcome those risk moderations.},

The risk level, identified for a particular construction contract, is a serious factor influencing the decision about accepting the contract or not. The key issue is proper identification of contract risk. The risk factors which have a significant impact on the success of the project, and are most common ones, are then analyzed. The method of verification depends on the company's experience in the construction industry. The task of the article is to present the results of studies focused on separating and determining the frequency of financial risk factors in construction projects and their impact on project implementation. We have analyzed 30 construction projects (office buildings, production halls, educational buildings, demolition works, etc.) completed in north-western Poland. The degree of risk (planned and real) for the contract was set as a percentage in relation to the size of contract (costs in million PLN). The aim of the study was to verify the existence of relationship between the kind of structure, the size of contract, and the scope and degree of risk. Statistical approach has been used. This study is a prelude to determining the contract risks identification procedure (i.e., estimating reserves to be used in unforeseen circumstances) so that the company could be competitive, and the price offer to be provided to investors could be advantageous.},

	abstract = {This study presents evidence of a developed ensemble of ensembles predictive model for delay prediction – a global phenomenon that has continued to strangle the construction sector despite considerable mitigation efforts. At first, a review of the existing body of knowledge on influencing factors of construction project delay was used to survey experts to approach its quantitative data collection. Secondly, data cleaning, feature selection, and engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and algorithm evaluation were carried out using the quantitative data to train ensemble machine learning algorithms (EMLA) – bagging, boosting, and naïve bayes, which in turn was used to develop hyperparameter optimized predictive models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Extremely Randomized Trees, Adaptive Boosting (CART), Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Finally, a multilayer high performant ensemble of ensembles (stacking) predictive model was developed to maximize the overall performance of the EMLA combined. Results from the evaluation metrics: accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1 score, and Compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) indeed proved that ensemble algorithms are capable of improving the predictive force relative to the use of a single algorithm in predicting construction projects delay.},

The main models of innovation diffusion were established by 1970. (Although the title implies that 1980 is the starting point of the review, we allowed ourselves to relax this constraint when necessary.) Modelling developments in the period 1970 onwards have been in modifying the existing models by adding greater flexibility in various ways. The objective here is to review the research in these different directions, with an emphasis on their contribution to improving on forecasting accuracy, or adding insight to the problem of forecasting.

The main categories of these modifications are: the introduction of marketing variables in the parameterisation of the models; generalising the models to consider innovations at different stages of diffusions in different countries; and generalising the models to consider the diffusion of successive generations of technology.

We find that, in terms of practical impact, the main application areas are the introduction of consumer durables and telecommunications.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) the efforts of many authors, few research questions have been finally resolved. For example, although there is some convergence of ideas of the most appropriate way to include marketing mix-variables into the Bass model, there are several viable alternative models.

Future directions of research are likely to include forecasting new product diffusion with little or no data, forecasting with multinational models, and forecasting with multi-generation models; work in normative modelling in this area has already been published.},

Introduction: The paper outlines the importance of understanding the diffusion of innovations, particularly in the fields of consumer durables and telecommunications. It notes that despite extensive research, many questions remain unresolved.


Literature Review: The authors review the main models of innovation diffusion established by 1970 and discuss the modifications made to these models over time. They categorize these modifications into three main types:


Introduction of marketing variables


Generalizing models for different stages of diffusion in different countries


Generalizing models for the diffusion of successive generations of technology




Methodology: The paper does not employ a new methodology but reviews existing ones, emphasizing their contributions to forecasting accuracy or adding insight into the problem of forecasting.


Findings: The paper finds that most research has focused on explaining past behavior rather than forecasting future behavior. It also notes that while there are some converging ideas on how to include marketing variables into models like the Bass model, alternative models still exist.


Conclusion: The paper concludes by suggesting future directions for research, including forecasting new product diffusion with little or no data, multinational models, and multi-generation models.

Method: Two SEM models with two and four latent variables, respectively, and 10 observed risk variables were used to identify the strongest relationships that may lead to an accident on site. A random sample of 474 construction sites were visited and assessed in Spain from 2003 to 2010. Most of the samples were small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which is the predominant type of company in the Spanish construction industry. To assess the risk on sites and get the measurements of the variables included in the models, the validated method CONSRAT (Construction Sites Risk Assessment Tool) was used. After estimating the proposed models, an adequate fit was obtained for both of them. Results: Results provide empirical evidence that: (a) the factor “Resources on site” is more determinant in explaining influences on risk variables because of their influence on all risk variables (Model 1); (b) the factor “Site structure complexity” (which includes structure and organization, and safety resources available on site) has a stronger effect on risk variables than other factors related to intrinsic characteristics of the work, site, or companies (Model 2). Conclusions: These results mean that the complexity and resource factors that depend on companies are those that have the greatest impact on risks, which makes it possible for companies to undertake the appropriate risk control measures.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have evidenced their capacity to solve dynamic, uncertain and complex tasks. The aim of this current study is to develop a hybrid artificial intelligence model called integrative Random Forest classifier with Genetic Algorithm optimization (RF-GA) for delay problem prediction. At first, related sources and factors of delay problems are identified. A questionnaire is adopted to quantify the impact of delay sources on project performance. The developed hybrid model is trained using the collected data of the previous construction projects. The proposed RF-GA is validated against the classical version of an RF model using statistical performance measure indices. The achieved results of the developed hybrid RF-GA model revealed a good resultant performance in terms of accuracy, kappa and classification error. Based on the measured accuracy, kappa and classification error, RF-GA attained 91.67\%, 87\% and 8.33\%, respectively.

To this aim, a quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey was employed to understand the attitude of practitioners towards various factors causing cost increases. An advanced multivariate statistical approach of Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Relative Importance Index (RII) was utilized to analyze the questionnaire responses. The results of the RII analysis show that local wishes, defective estimations, and long processing times had the most impact on the cost increase during the planning phase. At the same time, scope changes, market conditions, and unforeseen ground conditions were the most influential parameters in the construction phase. Moreover, the results obtained from PLS-SEM reveal that external related factors had the most influence among the other grouped factors (i.e., pre-construction, project management and contractual relationship, contractor’s site management, and external) on cost overrun during the construction phase. Increasing the knowledge of these factors will allow for developing relevant project management approaches targeted at improving economic and environmental sustainability within both the planning and construction phases.},

The data were collected through a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis, relative important index method, and probability impact matrix analysis were carried out to classify and rank the risk factors.

PLS-SEM was employed to analyze data collected from a questionnaire survey of 314 participants comprising the clients, contractors, and consultants working in oil and gas construction projects. The results showed that the goodness of fit index of the model is 0.638. The developed model was deemed to fit because the analysis result of the coefficient of determination test (R2) of the model was 0.720, which indicates the significant explanation of the developed model for the relationship between the causes of risks and their effects on the success of projects. The most impacted internal risk categories include project management, feasibility study design, and resource material availability.

	abstract = {Projects delays are among the most pressing challenges faced by the construction sector attributed to the sector’s complexity and its inherent delay risk sources’ interdependence. Machine learning offers an ideal set of techniques capable of tackling such complex systems; however, adopting such techniques within the construction sector remains at an early stage. The goal of this study was to identify and develop machine learning models in order to facilitate accurate project delay risk analysis and prediction using objective data sources. As such, relevant delay risk sources and factors were first identified, and a multivariate data set of previous projects’ time performance and delay-inducing risk sources was then compiled. Subsequently, the complexity and interdependence of the system was uncovered through an exploratory data analysis. Accordingly, two suitable machine learning models, utilizing decision tree and naïve Bayesian classification algorithms, were identified and trained using the data set for predicting project delay extents. Finally, the predictive performances of both models were evaluated through cross validation tests, and the models were further compared using machine-learning-relevant performance indices. The evaluation results indicated that the naïve Bayesian model provides a better predictive performance for the data set examined. Ultimately, the work presented herein harnesses the power of machine learning to facilitate evidence-based decision making, while inherent risk factors are active, interdependent, and dynamic, thus empowering proactive project risk management strategies.},

	abstract = {Risk management is about identifying risks, assessing their impacts, and developing mitigation strategies to ensure project success. The difference between the expected and actual project outcomes is usually attributed to risk events and how they are managed throughout the project. Although there are several reference frameworks that explain how risks can be managed in construction projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of a common vocabulary for risk-related concepts. Poor definition of risk and patterns of risk propagation in a project decrease the reliability of risk models that are constructed to simulate project outcomes under different risk occurrence scenarios. This study aims to extend previous studies in risk management by presenting an ontology for relating risk-related concepts to cost overrun. The major idea is that cost overrun depends on causal relations between various risk sources (namely, risk paths) and sources of vulnerability that interfere with these paths. Ontology is used to develop a database system that represents risk event histories of international construction projects and to construct a model for estimation of cost overrun. It will form the basis of a multiagent system that can be used to simulate the negotiation process among project participants about sharing of costs considering the risk allocation clauses in the contract, sources of vulnerability, and causal relations between risk events and their impacts. The ontology is constructed by interaction with Turkish contractors working in international markets and extensive literature review on risk-related concepts. The validation test results provide evidence that the ontology is fairly effective to help Turkish contractors to assess cost overrun by considering sources of vulnerability and risk in international construction projects.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty of cost items is an important aspect of complex projects. Cost uncertainty analysis aims to help decision makers to understand and model different factors affecting funding exposure and ultimately estimate the cost of project. The common practice in cost uncertainty analysis includes breaking the project into cost items and probabilistically capturing the uncertainty of each item. Dependencies between these items are important and if not considered properly may influence the accuracy of cost estimation. However these dependencies are seldom examined and there are theoretical and practical obstacles in modeling them.  This paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian networks (BN) to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. BNs provide a framework for presenting causal relationships and enable probabilistic inference among a set of variables. The new approach explicitly quantifies uncertainty in project cost and also provides an appropriate method for modeling complex relationships in a project, such as common causal factors, formal use of experts' judgments, and learning from data to update previous beliefs and probabilities. The capabilities of the proposed approach are explained by a simple example.},

Introduction: The paper acknowledges that while construction claims are a burden on the industry, the process by which a problem turns into a claim remains unclear. It aims to go beyond individual factors and examine how technical, contractual, and behavioral factors interact to affect dispute development.


Theoretical Background: The paper discusses Williamson's framework of Market Failures, which explains how a combination of environmental and behavioral factors lead to contractual problems. It identifies three main factors that drive the development of disputes: project uncertainty, contractual problems, and opportunistic behavior.


Empirical Data: The authors collected data from 24 claims, which occurred on 14 projects. These claims ranged from less than \$10,000 to over \$5 million. The data were analyzed to identify similarities and differences across cases, and the paper presents various case studies to illustrate the types of disputes that can arise.


Model: The paper presents a process model that explains the development of disputes. It examines the combined effect of project uncertainty, contract, working relations, and problem-solving effectiveness on the development of disputes. The model develops a classification of problem situations and identifies the problem-solving requirements and the potential for dispute in each situation.


Recommendations: The paper concludes by identifying actions that can reduce the number and severity of claims, such as reducing project uncertainty, reducing contractual problems, reducing opportunistic behavior, increasing the project organization's problem-solving ability, and using alternative dispute resolution methods.

The paper aims to fill this gap by providing a qualitative investigation into the causes of delays in the UK construction industry (Page 2).
The study reviews existing literature on the causes of delays, noting that they can be grouped into three categories: input factors (concerned with labor, material, and equipment), internal environment (contractor, owner, and consultants), and exogenous factors (weather and government regulations) (Page 3).

Due to a dramatic shift in the capacity and volume of the Indian construction sector over the last decade, the need of a systematic analysis of the reasons of delays and developing a clear understanding among the industry professionals are highly crucial. Using a selected set of 45 attributes, this research first identified the key factors impacting delay in Indian construction industry and then established the relationship between the critical attributes for developing prediction models for assessing the impacts of these factors on delay. A questionnaire and personal interviews have formed the basis of this research. Factor analysis and regression modelling were used to examine the significance of the delay factors. From the factor analysis, most critical factors of construction delay were identified as (1) lack of commitment; (2) inefficient site management; (3) poor site coordination; (4) improper planning; (5) lack of clarity in project scope; (6) lack of communication; and (7) substandard contract. Regression model indicates slow decision from owner, poor labour productivity, architects' reluctance for change and rework due to mistakes in construction are the reasons that affect the overall delay of the project significantly.

The tool has been designed by using the previous projects of the partner firm as test cases and preferences of company professionals are taken into account while determining the functions of the tool.

In order to evaluate the usability of the tool, a usability test has been conducted by eight construction experts. Usability test results demonstrated that the tool can be utilized for prediction of probable risk paths and their impact on cost. Results of a case study, a building project in Serbia, have also been reported in this paper to demonstrate the functions and the performance of the tool.

Ignoring the relationship between cost overrun risks during the risk assessment process is one of the primary reasons construction projects go over budget. Conversely, recent studies have failed to account for potential interrelationships between risk factors in their machine learning (ML) models. Additionally, the presented ML models are not interpretable. Thus, this study contributes to the entire ML process using a Bayesian network (BN) classifier model by considering the possible interactions between predictors, which are cost overrun risks, to predict cost overrun and assess cost overrun risks. Furthermore, this study compared the BN classifier model’s performance accuracy to that of the Naive Bayes (NB) and decision tree (DT) models to determine the effect of considering possible correlations between cost overrun risks on prediction accuracy. Moreover, the most critical risks and their relationships are identified by interpreting the learned BN model. The results indicated that the 18 BN models demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 78.86\%, significantly higher than the NB and DT. The present study identified the most significant risks as an increase in the cost of materials, lack of knowledge and experience among human resources, and inflation.},

Though numerous delay studies predominate, what is lacking is constructive research to develop tools and techniques to wrestle the inherent problem. Consequently, this paper presents the development of a machine learning model for delay risk assessment in tall building projects. Initially, 36 delay risk factors were identified from previous literature, and subsequently developed into surveys to determine the likelihood and consequence of the risk factors. Forty-eight useable responses obtained from subject matter experts were used to develop a dataset suitable for machine learning application. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble methods were considered. Feature subset selection revealed that the most relevant independent variables include “slowness in decision making”; “delay in sub-contractors work”; “architects’/structural engineers’ late issuance of instruction”; and “waiting for approval of shop drawings and material samples”. The final results showed that the best model for predicting the risk of delay was based on ANN with a classification accuracy of 93.75\%. Ultimately, the model developed in this study could support construction professionals in project risk management of tall buildings.},

              Knowledge of the effect of various cash-flow factors on expected project profit is important to effectively manage productivity on construction projects. This study was conducted to develop and test the sensitivity of a Machine Learning Support Vector Regression Algorithm (SVRA) to predict construction project profit in Ghana.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The study relied on data from 150 institutional projects executed within the past five years (2014–2018) in developing the model. Eighty percent (80\%) of the data from the 150 projects was used at hyperparameter selection and final training phases of the model development and the remaining 20\% for model testing. Using MATLAB for Support Vector Regression, the parameters available for tuning were the epsilon values, the kernel scale, the box constraint and standardisations. The sensitivity index was computed to determine the degree to which the independent variables impact the dependent variable.
            
            
              Findings
              The developed model's predictions perfectly fitted the data and explained all the variability of the response data around its mean. Average predictive accuracy of 73.66\% was achieved with all the variables on the different projects in validation. The developed SVR model was sensitive to labour and loan.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The developed SVRA combines variation, defective works and labour with other financial constraints, which have been the variables used in previous studies. It will aid contractors in predicting profit on completion at commencement and also provide information on the effect of changes to cash-flow factors on profit.},

To fill this gap, a survey was conducted on 250 construction project organizations in the UK, which was followed by face-to-face interviews with experienced practitioners from 15 of these organizations. The common factors that inhibit both time and cost control during construction projects were first identified. Subsequently 90 mitigating measures have been developed for the top five leading inhibiting factors—design changes, risks/uncertainties, inaccurate evaluation of project time/duration, complexities and non-performance of subcontractors were recommended. These mitigating measures were classified as: preventive, predictive, corrective and organizational measures. They can be used as a checklist of good practice and help project managers to improve the effectiveness of control of their projects.},

The paper is structured into several key sections:


Introduction: The paper acknowledges that despite the availability of various control techniques and project control software, many construction projects still fail to meet their cost and time objectives. The research aims to identify the inhibiting factors and suggest mitigating measures.


Research Methods: The study adopts a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. A questionnaire survey was conducted on 250 construction project organizations in the UK, followed by face-to-face interviews with experienced practitioners from 15 of these organizations.


Survey Findings: The survey revealed that 58\% of respondents always apply time controls to their projects, and 84\% always apply cost control methods. The most popular time planning and control technique is the Gantt Bar Chart, followed by the Critical Path Method (CPM).


Inhibiting Factors: The paper identifies the top five leading inhibiting factors as design changes, risks/uncertainties, inaccurate evaluation of project time/duration, complexities, and non-performance of subcontractors.


Mitigating Measures: The paper suggests 90 mitigating measures classified as preventive, predictive, corrective, and organizational measures. These can serve as a checklist for project managers to improve the effectiveness of their control measures.

The paper titled "A fuzzy approach to construction project risk assessment and analysis: construction project risk management system" by V. Carr and J.H.M. Tah focuses on formalizing risk assessment in construction projects using fuzzy logic. The paper argues that the construction industry is fraught with risks that have often led to poor performance, including increased costs and time delays. It introduces a hierarchical risk breakdown structure (HRBS) to create a formal model for qualitative risk assessment.
Key Points:

Objective: The paper aims to formalize risk assessment in construction projects by introducing a hierarchical risk breakdown structure (HRBS). This structure allows for a stratified classification of risks and the development of a nomenclature for describing project risks (Page 1).
Methodology: The paper employs fuzzy logic to model qualitative risk assessment descriptions mathematically. It uses fuzzy approximation and composition to identify and quantify the relationships between risk sources and their consequences on project performance measures (Page 1).
Risk Classification: The paper classifies risks using the HRBS, which allows risks to be separated into those related to the management of internal resources (controllable) and those prevalent in the external environment (uncontrollable). It also distinguishes between local and global risks (Page 2).
Fuzzy Logic: The paper utilizes fuzzy logic to handle the vagueness and uncertainty inherent in risk assessment. It allows for the use of descriptive linguistic variables to define risk descriptions and their consequences (Page 3).
Risk Management Process: The paper identifies five processes that make up the risk management model: identification, assessment, analysis, handling, and monitoring. It aims to build on existing methodologies like PRAM and RAMP to develop a software prototype for testing the risk methodology (Page 3).

Relevance to Your Research Question:
Your research question focuses on integrating machine learning models to forecast margins and risks in construction projects. This paper could be particularly relevant for the following reasons:

Methodological Insights: The paper's use of fuzzy logic for risk assessment could offer an additional layer of sophistication when you are integrating various forecasting and risk assessment models.
Risk Classification: The hierarchical risk breakdown structure (HRBS) introduced in the paper could serve as a useful framework for categorizing and understanding the different types of risks that could affect construction project margins and outcomes.
Qualitative Risk Assessment: The paper's approach to handling qualitative descriptions through fuzzy logic could be integrated into your machine learning models to handle non-numeric or subjective data more effectively.
Formalized Risk Management: The paper's focus on formalizing risk management processes could align with your aim to create a comprehensive approach that integrates forecasting, risk assessment, and actionable recommendations.

The risk matrix presented in the paper could serve as a feature set for your model, helping it to predict not just the margins but also the potential risks involved in construction projects.

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses."--},

Combined with the 40,000 fits of the Monte Carlo study we did with Alain Debecker to quantify the uncertainties in logistic fits [1], probably qualifies me for an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the man who carried out the greatest number of logistic fits. It hasn't all been fun and games. There have also been blood and tears and not only from human errors. There have beenwhat I came to recognize as “misbehaviors” of reality. I have seen cases where an excellent fit and ensuing forecast were invalidated by later data. But well-established logistic growth reflects the action of a natural law. A disproved forecast is tantamount to violating this law. A law that becomes violated is not much of a law. What is going on? There is something here that needs to be sorted out.},

If the goal of the study is to develop prediction models, machine learning approaches such as the powerful random forest (RF) are often promising alternatives to standard statistical methods, especially in the context of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we review extensions of the standard RF method for the purpose of longitudinal data analysis. Extension methods are categorized according to the data structures for which they are designed. We consider both univariate and multivariate response longitudinal data and further categorize the repeated measurements according to whether the time effect is relevant. Even though most extensions are proposed for lowdimensional data, some can be applied to high-dimensional data. Information of available software implementations of the reviewed extensions is also given. We conclude with discussions on the limitations of our review and some future research directions.},

	abstract = {Random forests are one of the state-of-the-art supervised machine learning methods and achieve good performance in high-dimensional settings where p, the number of predictors, is much larger than n, the number of observations. Repeated measurements provide, in general, additional information, hence they are worth accounted especially when analyzing high-dimensional data. Tree-based methods have already been adapted to clustered and longitudinal data by using a semi-parametric mixed effects model, in which the non-parametric part is estimated using regression trees or random forests. We propose a general approach of random forests for high-dimensional longitudinal data. It includes a flexible stochastic model which allows the covariance structure to vary over time. Furthermore, we introduce a new method which takes intra-individual covariance into consideration to build random forests. Through simulation experiments, we then study the behavior of different estimation methods, especially in the context of high-dimensional data. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to an HIV vaccine trial including 17 HIV-infected patients with 10 repeated measurements of 20,000 gene transcripts and blood concentration of human immunodeficiency virus RNA. The approach selected 21 gene transcripts for which the association with HIV viral load was fully relevant and consistent with results observed during primary infection.},

	abstract = {With the advent of Big Data, nowadays in many applications databases containing large quantities of similar time series are available. Forecasting time series in these domains with traditional univariate forecasting procedures leaves great potentials for producing accurate forecasts untapped. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have proven recently that they are able to outperform state-of-the-art univariate time series forecasting methods in this context when trained across all available time series. However, if the time series database is heterogeneous, accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards fully automatic forecasting methods in this space, a notion of similarity between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks, a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmarking datasets under competition evaluation procedures. In particular, in terms of mean sMAPE accuracy, it consistently outperforms the baseline LSTM model and outperforms all other methods on the CIF2016 forecasting competition dataset.},

            In this paper, we consider the task of predicting the electricity power generated by photovoltaic solar systems for the next day at half‐hourly intervals. We introduce DL, a deep learning approach based on feed‐forward neural networks for big data time series, which decomposes the forecasting problem into several sub‐problems. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using 2 years of Australian solar data, evaluating accuracy and training time, and comparing the performance of DL with two other advanced methods based on neural networks and pattern sequence similarity. We investigate the use of multiple data sources (solar power and weather data for the previous days, and weather forecast for the next day) and also study the effect of different historical window sizes. The results show that DL produces competitive accuracy results and scales well, and is thus a highly suitable method for big data environments.},

Each domain and data type presents its own set of challenges.

Continual learning is a paradigm of machine learning to handle situations when the stationarity of the datasets may no longer be true or required. This paper presents a systematic review of the recent Deep Learning applications of sensor time series, the need for advanced preprocessing techniques for some sensor environments, as well as the summaries of how to deploy Deep Learning in time series modeling while alleviating catastrophic forgetting with continual learning methods. The selected case studies cover a wide collection of various sensor time series applications and can illustrate how to deploy tailor-made Deep Learning, advanced preprocessing techniques, and continual learning algorithms from practical, real-world application aspects.},

	annote = {The paper titled "A hybrid method of exponential smoothing and recurrent neural networks for time series forecasting" by Smyl (2020) introduces a novel approach to time series forecasting by amalgamating Exponential Smoothing (ES) techniques with Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs). This hybrid method leverages machine learning's capacity to discern intricate non-linear patterns in substantial datasets, addressing the challenges posed by limited data availability and absent regressors, which typically hamper machine learning performance in time series analysis.
The core idea behind this methodology is to utilize the ES equations and LSTM networks complementarily. The ES equations adeptly capture crucial components like seasonality and level in individual series, whereas the LSTMs facilitate capturing non-linear trends and cross-learning among various series. The data is exploited hierarchically, utilizing both local and global components to enhance forecasting accuracy by amalgamating information from either a single series or a dataset level. This approach thus, outperforms pure statistical or traditional machine learning methods in forecasting accuracy.
Key to the method's effectiveness is its preprocessing stage, where instead of applying a standard deseasonalization, the hybrid method employs adaptive normalization and deseasonalization in an on-the-fly manner. This preprocessing is crucial as it ensures small-valued inputs have a minimal impact during the learning process, promoting better learning and forecasting. Moreover, the method employs an Ensemble of Specialists approach for better accuracy, where several concurrently trained models, learning from different subsets of series, are used. The final forecast for a particular series is derived by averaging the forecasts produced by the top models from different runs, thereby mitigating the effect of randomness and decreasing uncertainty.
A notable contribution of this paper is the introduction of a hybrid forecasting method that synergistically combines ES-inspired formulas with advanced neural networks. This combination ensures effective deseasonalization and normalization of the series, alongside efficient extrapolation of the series using neural networks. The method ingeniously combines a globally learned part across many time series with time series-specific parts, leading to a hierarchical model structure facilitated by Dynamic Computational Graphs. This design yields a partially understandable machine learning model, making a significant stride towards decipherable machine learning models in time series forecasting.
The method, as demonstrated in the paper, shows promising results especially for monthly, yearly, and quarterly data frequencies. However, Smyl (2020) suggests that further exploration is warranted to delineate the areas of superiority of each method involved.

	annote = {The paper "Investigating the accuracy of cross-learning time series forecasting methods" by Semenoglou et al., delves into the exploration of Cross-Learning (CL) methods in time series forecasting, leveraging data from multiple series to enhance the predictive accuracy of individual series. In contrast to traditional series-by-series forecasting, CL extracts patterns from a broad dataset, enabling a more holistic understanding of the underlying data generation process (DGP). The superior performance of CL was evidenced by top performers in a forecasting competition who utilized complete datasets for predictions, showcasing the model's ability to approximate DGP and capture primary features, thereby producing more accurate results.
Several models and methods were explored in the study, including an XGBoost model and a dynamic computational graph neural network system, both employed to augment traditional forecasting models. Despite the promise, CL and hybrid methods are noted to remain largely unexplored, with a majority of studies focusing on meta-learning and Feature-Based (FB) forecasting approaches. The study contends that selecting the "best" method is not straightforward and underlines the necessity of having a diverse, balanced set of series for effective learning.
Moreover, the study addressed challenges such as data scaling and seasonal adjustments, which are crucial for importing different series into a single model. To enhance the CL approach, the paper proposed exploiting time series features either as direct inputs or for creating clusters of series, which would help in modeling different types of series more effectively. It also explored hybrid models, combining the CL approach with traditional methods to potentially improve forecasting solutions.
The investigation highlighted that the accuracy of forecasts depends significantly on the model's exposure to similar inputs, making the collection and alignment of diverse datasets a prerequisite. However, it also pointed out the increased computational time required by CL methods, which necessitates experienced forecasters for design and tuning. The study concludes with a positive note on the potential of CL in improving forecasting accuracy, albeit with a trade-off in computational time, and suggests that the creation of "specialists" for clustered series may not be the optimal application of CL.

One dominant approach is through panel data analysis in which the behaviors of multiple units are observed over time. The information across time and space motivates two general approaches: (i) horizontal regression (i.e., unconfoundedness), which exploits time series patterns, and (ii) vertical regression (e.g., synthetic controls), which exploits cross-sectional patterns. Conventional wisdom states that the two approaches are fundamentally different. We establish this position to be partly false for estimation but generally true for inference. In particular, we prove that both approaches yield identical point estimates under several standard settings. For the same point estimate, however, each approach quantifies uncertainty with respect to a distinct estimand. In turn, the confidence interval developed for one estimand may have incorrect coverage for another.

	abstract = {This paper presents an estimator for semiparametric models that uses a feed-forward neural network to fit the nonparametric component. Unlike many methodologies from the machine learning literature, this approach is suitable for longitudinal/panel data. It provides unbiased estimation of the parametric component of the model, with associated confidence intervals that have near-nominal coverage rates. Simulations demonstrate (1) efficiency, (2) that parametric estimates are unbiased, and (3) coverage properties of estimated intervals. An application section demonstrates the method by predicting county-level corn yield using daily weather data from the period 1981-2015, along with parametric time trends representing technological change. The method is shown to out-perform linear methods such as OLS and ridge/lasso, as well as random forest. The procedures described in this paper are implemented in the R package panelNNET.},

	abstract = {Forecasting high-dimensional time series plays a crucial role in many applications such as demand forecasting and financial predictions. Modern datasets can have millions of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e they are extremely high dimensional (one dimension for each individual time-series). There is a need for exploiting global patterns and coupling them with local calibration for better prediction. However, most recent deep learning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e, even though they are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future forecast for a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension. In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep forecasting model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular, DeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix factorization model regularized by a temporal convolution network, along with another temporal network that can capture local properties of each time-series and associated covariates. Our model can be trained effectively on high-dimensional but diverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different scales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results demonstrate that DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for example, we see more than 25\% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a public dataset that contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.},

	abstract = {Producing probabilistic forecasts for large collections of similar and/or dependent time series is a practically highly relevant, yet challenging task. Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes, but their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efficient and allows them to provide estimates of uncertainty. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part and extensive experiments. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model both in term of data efficiency and computational complexity.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2103.07719},
	abstract = {Multivariate time-series forecasting plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships. In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies {\textbackslash}textit\{jointly\} in the {\textbackslash}textit\{spectral domain\}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules. Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/StemGNN/},
