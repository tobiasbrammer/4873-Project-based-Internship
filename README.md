# 4873-Project-based-Internship
Project-based internship at ELCON in autumn 2023.
Part of my Masters degree in Economics at Aarhus University. The internship is worth 20 ECTS-points, and will be my final course before writing the Masters Thesis in the spring of 2024.

## Problem Statement
The construction sector, including ELCON's Contracting Division, faces numerous challenges such as constrained profit margins, frequent cost overruns, and fluctuating productivity metrics. These challenges are exacerbated within the division due to its responsibility for managing a substantial portfolio of 300 distinct projects. The conventional methodologies currently in use have proven inadequate in addressing the complex and dynamic nature of construction projects. This necessitates the exploration of more advanced and integrated approaches to better manage and forecast project outcomes.

The core research question driving this investigation is:
**Can Machine Learning Models Accurately Forecast Margins and Risks of Construction Projects?**
This question arises from the limitations observed in the current subjective risk assessment practices within ELCON's Contracting Division, which lack a formal statistical foundation. The division's significant contribution to the company's financials underscores the urgent need for a more robust and adaptable data model. Such a model is envisioned to accurately evaluate risks, forecast margins, and support more informed decision-making, thereby enhancing the overall management of construction projects.

## Data Model
