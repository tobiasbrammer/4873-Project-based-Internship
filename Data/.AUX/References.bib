	abstract = {This paper reviews the literature of construction risk modelling and assessment. It also reviews the real practice of risk assessment. The review resulted in significant results, summarised as follows. There has been a major shift in risk perception from an estimation variance into a project attribute. Although the Probability–Impact risk model is prevailing, substantial efforts are being put to improving it reflecting the increasing complexity of construction projects. The literature lacks a comprehensive assessment approach capable of capturing risk impact on different project objectives. Obtaining a realistic project risk level demands an effective mechanism for aggregating individual risk assessments. The various assessment tools suffer from low take-up; professionals typically rely on their experience. It is concluded that a simple analytical tool that uses risk cost as a common scale and utilises professional experience could be a viable option to facilitate closing the gap between theory and practice of risk assessment.},

To fill this gap, a survey was conducted on 250 construction project organizations in the UK, which was followed by face-to-face interviews with experienced practitioners from 15 of these organizations. The common factors that inhibit both time and cost control during construction projects were first identified. Subsequently 90 mitigating measures have been developed for the top five leading inhibiting factors—design changes, risks/uncertainties, inaccurate evaluation of project time/duration, complexities and non-performance of subcontractors were recommended. These mitigating measures were classified as: preventive, predictive, corrective and organizational measures. They can be used as a checklist of good practice and help project managers to improve the effectiveness of control of their projects.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Knowledge of the effect of various cash-flow factors on expected project profit is important to effectively manage productivity on construction projects. This study was conducted to develop and test the sensitivity of a Machine Learning Support Vector Regression Algorithm (SVRA) to predict construction project profit in Ghana.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The study relied on data from 150 institutional projects executed within the past five years (2014–2018) in developing the model. Eighty percent (80\%) of the data from the 150 projects was used at hyperparameter selection and final training phases of the model development and the remaining 20\% for model testing. Using MATLAB for Support Vector Regression, the parameters available for tuning were the epsilon values, the kernel scale, the box constraint and standardisations. The sensitivity index was computed to determine the degree to which the independent variables impact the dependent variable.
            
            
              Findings
              The developed model's predictions perfectly fitted the data and explained all the variability of the response data around its mean. Average predictive accuracy of 73.66\% was achieved with all the variables on the different projects in validation. The developed SVR model was sensitive to labour and loan.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The developed SVRA combines variation, defective works and labour with other financial constraints, which have been the variables used in previous studies. It will aid contractors in predicting profit on completion at commencement and also provide information on the effect of changes to cash-flow factors on profit.},

Though numerous delay studies predominate, what is lacking is constructive research to develop tools and techniques to wrestle the inherent problem. Consequently, this paper presents the development of a machine learning model for delay risk assessment in tall building projects. Initially, 36 delay risk factors were identified from previous literature, and subsequently developed into surveys to determine the likelihood and consequence of the risk factors. Forty-eight useable responses obtained from subject matter experts were used to develop a dataset suitable for machine learning application. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble methods were considered. Feature subset selection revealed that the most relevant independent variables include “slowness in decision making”; “delay in sub-contractors work”; “architects’/structural engineers’ late issuance of instruction”; and “waiting for approval of shop drawings and material samples”. The final results showed that the best model for predicting the risk of delay was based on ANN with a classification accuracy of 93.75\%. Ultimately, the model developed in this study could support construction professionals in project risk management of tall buildings.},

However, this duty is particularly complex and inefficient if good risk management has not been done from the beginning of the project. An effective and efficient risk management approach requires a proper and systematic methodology and, more importantly, knowledge and experience. Previous research results in Chile have shown that both, owners and contractors do not systematically apply risk management practices, resulting in negative consequences for projects’ performance. This paper addresses the problems of risk management in construction projects using a knowledge-based approach, and proposes a methodology based on a three-fold arrangement that includes the modeling of the risk management function, its evaluation, and the availability of a best practices model. This approach is part of a * research effort that is underway. A major preliminary conclusion of this research is the fact that risk management in construction projects is still very ineffective and that the main cause of this situation is the lack of knowledge. It is expected that the application of the proposed approach will allow clients and contractors to develop a project's risk management function based on best practices, and also to improve the performance of this function.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty of cost items is an important aspect of complex projects. Cost uncertainty analysis aims to help decision makers to understand and model different factors affecting funding exposure and ultimately estimate the cost of project. The common practice in cost uncertainty analysis includes breaking the project into cost items and probabilistically capturing the uncertainty of each item. Dependencies between these items are important and if not considered properly may influence the accuracy of cost estimation. However these dependencies are seldom examined and there are theoretical and practical obstacles in modeling them.  This paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian networks (BN) to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. BNs provide a framework for presenting causal relationships and enable probabilistic inference among a set of variables. The new approach explicitly quantifies uncertainty in project cost and also provides an appropriate method for modeling complex relationships in a project, such as common causal factors, formal use of experts' judgments, and learning from data to update previous beliefs and probabilities. The capabilities of the proposed approach are explained by a simple example.},

	abstract = {Introduction: This study develops an empirical test of two theoretical models using the approach of Structural Equation Model (SEM) to test the relationships between specific organizational factors of safety management system (SMS) and specific risk variables. Method: Two SEM models with two and four latent variables, respectively, and 10 observed risk variables were used to identify the strongest relationships that may lead to an accident on site. A random sample of 474 construction sites were visited and assessed in Spain from 2003 to 2010. Most of the samples were small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), which is the predominant type of company in the Spanish construction industry. To assess the risk on sites and get the measurements of the variables included in the models, the validated method CONSRAT (Construction Sites Risk Assessment Tool) was used. After estimating the proposed models, an adequate fit was obtained for both of them. Results: Results provide empirical evidence that: (a) the factor “Resources on site” is more determinant in explaining influences on risk variables because of their influence on all risk variables (Model 1); (b) the factor “Site structure complexity” (which includes structure and organization, and safety resources available on site) has a stronger effect on risk variables than other factors related to intrinsic characteristics of the work, site, or companies (Model 2). Conclusions: These results mean that the complexity and resource factors that depend on companies are those that have the greatest impact on risks, which makes it possible for companies to undertake the appropriate risk control measures. Practical Application: These results can help construction firms obtain earlier information about which organizational elements can affect future safety conditions on site, improve those elements for preventing risks, and consequently, avoid accidents before they occur.},

	abstract = {The wealth of research into modelling and forecasting the diffusion of innovations is impressive and confirms its continuing importance as a research topic. The main models of innovation diffusion were established by 1970. (Although the title implies that 1980 is the starting point of the review, we allowed ourselves to relax this constraint when necessary.) Modelling developments in the period 1970 onwards have been in modifying the existing models by adding greater flexibility in various ways. The objective here is to review the research in these different directions, with an emphasis on their contribution to improving on forecasting accuracy, or adding insight to the problem of forecasting.

The main categories of these modifications are: the introduction of marketing variables in the parameterisation of the models; generalising the models to consider innovations at different stages of diffusions in different countries; and generalising the models to consider the diffusion of successive generations of technology.

We find that, in terms of practical impact, the main application areas are the introduction of consumer durables and telecommunications.

In spite of (or perhaps because of) the efforts of many authors, few research questions have been finally resolved. For example, although there is some convergence of ideas of the most appropriate way to include marketing mix-variables into the Bass model, there are several viable alternative models.

Future directions of research are likely to include forecasting new product diffusion with little or no data, forecasting with multinational models, and forecasting with multi-generation models; work in normative modelling in this area has already been published.},

Machine learning is a major area of interest within the field of artificial intelligence, playing a pivotal role in the process of making construction “smart”. The application of machine learning in construction has the potential to open up an array of opportunities such as site supervision, automatic detection, and intelligent maintenance. However, the implementation of machine learning faces a range of challenges due to the difficulties in acquiring labeled data, especially when applied in a highly complex construction site environment. This paper reviews the history of machine learning development from shallow to deep learning and its applications in construction. The strengths and weaknesses of machine learning technology in construction have been analyzed in order to foresee the future direction of machine learning applications in this sphere. Furthermore, this paper presents suggestions which may benefit researchers in terms of combining specific knowledge domains in construction with machine learning algorithms so as to develop dedicated deep network models for the industry.},

Machine learning offers an ideal set of techniques capable of tackling such complex systems; however, adopting such techniques within the construction sector remains at an early stage. The goal of this study was to identify and develop machine learning models in order to facilitate accurate project delay risk analysis and prediction using objective data sources. As such, relevant delay risk sources and factors were first identified, and a multivariate data set of previous projects’ time performance and delay-inducing risk sources was then compiled. Subsequently, the complexity and interdependence of the system was uncovered through an exploratory data analysis. Accordingly, two suitable machine learning models, utilizing decision tree and naïve Bayesian classification algorithms, were identified and trained using the data set for predicting project delay extents. Finally, the predictive performances of both models were evaluated through cross validation tests, and the models were further compared using machine-learning-relevant performance indices. The evaluation results indicated that the naïve Bayesian model provides a better predictive performance for the data set examined. Ultimately, the work presented herein harnesses the power of machine learning to facilitate evidence-based decision making, while inherent risk factors are active, interdependent, and dynamic, thus empowering proactive project risk management strategies.},

The risk level, identified for a particular construction contract, is a serious factor influencing the decision about accepting the contract or not. The key issue is proper identification of contract risk. The risk factors which have a significant impact on the success of the project, and are most common ones, are then analyzed. The method of verification depends on the company's experience in the construction industry. The task of the article is to present the results of studies focused on separating and determining the frequency of financial risk factors in construction projects and their impact on project implementation. We have analyzed 30 construction projects (office buildings, production halls, educational buildings, demolition works, etc.) completed in north-western Poland. The degree of risk (planned and real) for the contract was set as a percentage in relation to the size of contract (costs in million PLN). The aim of the study was to verify the existence of relationship between the kind of structure, the size of contract, and the scope and degree of risk. Statistical approach has been used. This study is a prelude to determining the contract risks identification procedure (i.e., estimating reserves to be used in unforeseen circumstances) so that the company could be competitive, and the price offer to be provided to investors could be advantageous.},

The changes of the business environment, often associated with shortage of funds, exchange rate fluctuation and political instability increase the construction projects financial risks. In this context, the application of structured approaches related to the financial planning, scheduling and monitoring of the projects is even more important. In order to execute these processes, the project managers should have the necessary competences. The development of financial management competencies cannot be achieved into the classical educational settings, by using common methods of knowledge transfer. Instead, the project financial management should be taught in active and experiential ways, stimulating students to think creatively and to act properly as project managers. Education simulations are very valuable in this regards.
The paper presents the experience gained in the master program of Project Management in Construction held in the Technical University of Civil Engineering Bucharest. Based on the main international project management competence standards and relevant educational experiences, the authors designed a simulation platform.

At first, a review of the existing body of knowledge on influencing factors of construction project delay was used to survey experts to approach its quantitative data collection. Secondly, data cleaning, feature selection, and engineering, hyperparameter optimization, and algorithm evaluation were carried out using the quantitative data to train ensemble machine learning algorithms (EMLA) – bagging, boosting, and naïve bayes, which in turn was used to develop hyperparameter optimized predictive models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, Extremely Randomized Trees, Adaptive Boosting (CART), Gradient Boosting Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Finally, a multilayer high performant ensemble of ensembles (stacking) predictive model was developed to maximize the overall performance of the EMLA combined. Results from the evaluation metrics: accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1 score, and Compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) indeed proved that ensemble algorithms are capable of improving the predictive force relative to the use of a single algorithm in predicting construction projects delay.},

Additionally, the presented ML models are not interpretable. Thus, this study contributes to the entire ML process using a Bayesian network (BN) classifier model by considering the possible interactions between predictors, which are cost overrun risks, to predict cost overrun and assess cost overrun risks. Furthermore, this study compared the BN classifier model’s performance accuracy to that of the Naive Bayes (NB) and decision tree (DT) models to determine the effect of considering possible correlations between cost overrun risks on prediction accuracy. Moreover, the most critical risks and their relationships are identified by interpreting the learned BN model. The results indicated that the 18 BN models demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 78.86\%, significantly higher than the NB and DT. The present study identified the most significant risks as an increase in the cost of materials, lack of knowledge and experience among human resources, and inflation.},

This paper proposes a knowledge-based risk mapping tool for systematically assessing risk-related variables that may lead to cost overrun in international markets. The tool uses an ontology that relates risk and vulnerability to cost overrun [1] and a novel risk-vulnerability assessment methodology [2] to estimate potential risk paths that may emerge in international construction projects. The tool has been developed in collaboration with an industrial partner, a construction management company that gives risk management consultancy services to Turkish contractors working in international markets. The tool has been designed by using the previous projects of the partner firm as test cases and preferences of company professionals are taken into account while determining the functions of the tool. As the reliability and usability of the tool significantly depend on the subjective evaluations of users about level of vulnerability and magnitude of potential risk events, a lessons learned database has been incorporated into the tool so that decision-makers may refer to risk event histories of previous projects to make estimations about forthcoming projects. In order to evaluate the usability of the tool, a usability test has been conducted by eight construction experts. Usability test results demonstrated that the tool can be utilized for prediction of probable risk paths and their impact on cost. Results of a case study, a building project in Serbia, have also been reported in this paper to demonstrate the functions and the performance of the tool. Although the usability and reliability test results are satisfactory, the tool should be seen as an initial platform which should be improved by increasing its “intelligence” by high quality and enough number of risk event histories, and also customized according to user preferences as well as company policies.},

Due to a dramatic shift in the capacity and volume of the Indian construction sector over the last decade, the need of a systematic analysis of the reasons of delays and developing a clear understanding among the industry professionals are highly crucial. Using a selected set of 45 attributes, this research first identified the key factors impacting delay in Indian construction industry and then established the relationship between the critical attributes for developing prediction models for assessing the impacts of these factors on delay. A questionnaire and personal interviews have formed the basis of this research. Factor analysis and regression modelling were used to examine the significance of the delay factors. From the factor analysis, most critical factors of construction delay were identified as (1) lack of commitment; (2) inefficient site management; (3) poor site coordination; (4) improper planning; (5) lack of clarity in project scope; (6) lack of communication; and (7) substandard contract. Regression model indicates slow decision from owner, poor labour productivity, architects' reluctance for change and rework due to mistakes in construction are the reasons that affect the overall delay of the project significantly. These findings are expected to be significant contributions to Indian construction industry in controlling the time overruns in construction contracts.},

	abstract = {Avoiding construction claims and disputes requires an understanding of the contractual terms and causes of claims. The dual underlying theme of this paper is to investigate the causes of delays on 130 public projects in Jordan and to aid construction managers in establishing adequate evaluation prior to the contract award using quantitative data. Projects investigated in this study included residential, office and administration buildings, school buildings, medical centers and communication facilities. Results of this study indicates the main causes of delay in construction of public projects relate to designers, user changes, weather, site conditions, late deliveries, economic conditions and increase in quantity. The presence of these factors have an impact on the successful completion of the projects at the time contractually specified. The findings suggest that special attention to factors identified in this study will help industry practitioners in minimising the risk of contract disputes.},

	abstract = {Purpose Construction project delays are described as a universal problem, which has led to many empirical studies. However, most of these studies were based on the rankings by respondents, and they were rarely verified. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore professional perspectives on the causes of delay in the construction industry, where there has been little explicit consideration on this subject in recent decades.Design/methodology/approach A critical literature review and a qualitative approach was considered for a deeper and fresh understanding of the causes of delays, rather than recycling the existing themes and the risk of a statistically biased approach. A total of 41 interviews were undertaken which included the London Olympic 2012 project team.Findings In all, 32 themes were identified, which were categorised into 15 categories of causes of delay in the construction projects. Almost two-thirds of the main themes are not ranked top 15 causes of delay. These include knowledge and competence shortage, poor commercial decisions, unnecessary health and safety restrictions, poor risk management and poor space and logistics management.Research limitations/implications Due to the qualitative nature of the study, the findings might not be considered as representative.Practical implications The findings provide consideration of the causes of delay in the construction industry as seen by practitioners, which should provide guidance to enhance performance.Originality/value The study contributes to the better understanding of the causes of delays by using qualitative research strategy which is limited in the construction management literature. This study is an empirical investigation into the causes of delay in the twenty-first century and it represents an important edition to the body of knowledge within the subject area.},

The data used to develop the model was collected using a questionnaire survey, which targeted construction practitioners in the Malaysian construction industry. A five-point Likert type scale was used to rate the significance of the factors. The factors were classified under their relevant construct/group using exploratory factor analysis. A hypothetical model was developed and then transformed into Smart-PLS in which the hypothetical model suggested that each group of the cause factors has a direct impact on the effect groups. The hypothesis was tested using t-values and p-values. The model was assessed for its inner and outer components and achieved the threshold criterion. Further, the model was verified by engaging 14 construction experts to verify its applicability in the construction project setting.,The study developed a structural equation model to clarify the relationships between causes and effects of poor communication in construction projects. The model explained the degree of relationships among causes and effects of poor communication in construction projects.,The published academic and non-academic literature introduced many studies on the issue of communication including the definitions, importance, barriers to effective communication and means of poor communication. However, these studies ended up only on the general issue of communication lacking an in-depth investigation of the causes and effects of poor communication in the construction industry. The study implemented advanced structural modeling to study the causes and effects. The questionnaire, the data and concluding results fill the identified research gap of this study. The addressed issue is also of interest because communication is considered one of the main knowledge areas in construction management.},

However, in the last two years, Lebanon has been suffering from a severe economic crisis, which has affected various numbers of businesses and industries, specifically the construction industry. Therefore, this article is carried out to identify, classify and analyse the most significant risks inherent in the Lebanese construction industry with special emphasis on the financial and economic risk category and eventually establish a conclusion in this regard. To achieve the aims of this research, the data was collected by conducting a questionnaire survey among experts in the Lebanese construction industry. The results showed that the construction industry in Lebanon is exposed to many risk sources, internal and external and the most important are the financial risk such as fluctuation of the currency, inflation, lack of solvency, etc. Finally, the importance and benefits of implementing risk management are discussed in this research as well as the barriers to its effective implementation.},

	abstract = {Risk management is about identifying risks, assessing their impacts, and developing mitigation strategies to ensure project success. The difference between the expected and actual project outcomes is usually attributed to risk events and how they are managed throughout the project. Although there are several reference frameworks that explain how risks can be managed in construction projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of a common vocabulary for risk-related concepts. Poor definition of risk and patterns of risk propagation in a project decrease the reliability of risk models that are constructed to simulate project outcomes under different risk occurrence scenarios. This study aims to extend previous studies in risk management by presenting an ontology for relating risk-related concepts to cost overrun. The major idea is that cost overrun depends on causal relations between various risk sources (namely, risk paths) and sources of vulnerability that interfere with these paths. Ontology is used to develop a database system that represents risk event histories of international construction projects and to construct a model for estimation of cost overrun. It will form the basis of a multiagent system that can be used to simulate the negotiation process among project participants about sharing of costs considering the risk allocation clauses in the contract, sources of vulnerability, and causal relations between risk events and their impacts. The ontology is constructed by interaction with Turkish contractors working in international markets and extensive literature review on risk-related concepts. The validation test results provide evidence that the ontology is fairly effective to help Turkish contractors to assess cost overrun by considering sources of vulnerability and risk in international construction projects.},

Modeling results found that a stacking model that combined the results from several classifiers produced the best results.

The model performed best in predicting projects completed with large cost overruns and projects near the original low bid amount. It was found that a stacking model that used only numerical data produced predictions with lower precision and recall. A potential application of this research is as an aid in budgeting sufficient funds to complete a construction project.

However, these projects usually face chronic risks that lead to time overrun, cost overrun, and poor quality, affecting the projects’ success. Hence, this study focused on identifying, classifying, and modeling the risk factors that have negative effects on the success of construction projects in Yemen. The data were collected through a structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis, relative important index method, and probability impact matrix analysis were carried out to classify and rank the risk factors. The partial least squares path modeling or partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-PM, PLS-SEM) is a method for structural equation modeling that allows an estimation of complex cause–effect relationships in path models with latent variables. PLS-SEM was employed to analyze data collected from a questionnaire survey of 314 participants comprising the clients, contractors, and consultants working in oil and gas construction projects. The results showed that the goodness of fit index of the model is 0.638. The developed model was deemed to fit because the analysis result of the coefficient of determination test (R2) of the model was 0.720, which indicates the significant explanation of the developed model for the relationship between the causes of risks and their effects on the success of projects. The most impacted internal risk categories include project management, feasibility study design, and resource material availability. The main external risk elements include political, economic, and security considerations. The created risk factor model explained the influence of risk factors on the success of construction projects effectively, according to statistical and expert validation tests.},

              Successful risk management is influential in different phases of construction projects. It can play a critical role in reducing the possibility of claims as well as related disputes. The risk management knowledge area in large capital projects such as oil and gas is considered a questionable problem in the construction industry. The present study makes an effort to identify the importance of process groups in improving risk management performance.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                This study is selected and ranked 36 factors leading to the claim in Iran's oil and gas industry through the Delphi method and a questionnaire. Factors categorized into a risk breakdown structure (RBS) include eight groups. Factors are linked to one of the process groups by a Delphi method. Finally, the relationship between RBS and the five process groups is analyzed using partial least squares 
                structural equation modeling (
                PLS-SEM).
              
            
            
              Findings
              Findings showed that the planning process group had more confirmed factors than others. Most of the supported communications belonged to the contractor and the owner parties. Also, the cause of delay in the implementation phase due to the contractor performance had a higher relative importance index.

              This article, from a project life-cycle perspective, considers the new structure between the risks leading to claims and the key parties to the project. It can be a good criterion for identifying risks and a timelier response to them before the risks turn into disagreements.},

This study investigates the effects of various factors affecting the cost performance of large-scale road projects in Norway in both the planning and construction phases. To this aim, a quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey was employed to understand the attitude of practitioners towards various factors causing cost increases. An advanced multivariate statistical approach of Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Relative Importance Index (RII) was utilized to analyze the questionnaire responses. The results of the RII analysis show that local wishes, defective estimations, and long processing times had the most impact on the cost increase during the planning phase. At the same time, scope changes, market conditions, and unforeseen ground conditions were the most influential parameters in the construction phase. Moreover, the results obtained from PLS-SEM reveal that external related factors had the most influence among the other grouped factors (i.e., pre-construction, project management and contractual relationship, contractor’s site management, and external) on cost overrun during the construction phase. Increasing the knowledge of these factors will allow for developing relevant project management approaches targeted at improving economic and environmental sustainability within both the planning and construction phases.},

At first, related sources and factors of delay problems are identified. A questionnaire is adopted to quantify the impact of delay sources on project performance. The developed hybrid model is trained using the collected data of the previous construction projects. The proposed RF-GA is validated against the classical version of an RF model using statistical performance measure indices. The achieved results of the developed hybrid RF-GA model revealed a good resultant performance in terms of accuracy, kappa and classification error. Based on the measured accuracy, kappa and classification error, RF-GA attained 91.67\%, 87\% and 8.33\%, respectively.

            The infrastructural and economic development of a country merely depends on the construction industry and its growth. There are many risk factors involved with the construction industry during planning, execution and commissioning of the projects. Dealing with the risk factors in construction industry have been known as a crucial management process in order to achieve the overall objectives of the industry in terms of cost, time, safety, quality and environmental sustainability. This report is related with the financial aspects which directly take part in the industry for which studies have been conducted with various engineers, contractors and labors in and around north-western districts of Tamilnadu. The perspectives at different levels of management have been concluded with the standard questionnaire format that has been investigated and their results are analyzed based on the current scenario. With the help of these surveys and data analysis by Relative Importance Index (RII), the most related factors among the identified factors were found to be labour risk, material risk, credit risk, planning risk, execution and environmental related factors. The suggestions and recommendations have been expressed to overcome those risk moderations.},

It hasn't all been fun and games. There have also been blood and tears and not only from human errors. There have beenwhat I came to recognize as “misbehaviors” of reality. I have seen cases where an excellent fit and ensuing forecast were invalidated by later data. But well-established logistic growth reflects the action of a natural law. A disproved forecast is tantamount to violating this law. A law that becomes violated is not much of a law. What is going on? There is something here that needs to be sorted out.},

Unlike many methodologies from the machine learning literature, this approach is suitable for longitudinal/panel data. It provides unbiased estimation of the parametric component of the model, with associated confidence intervals that have near-nominal coverage rates. Simulations demonstrate (1) efficiency, (2) that parametric estimates are unbiased, and (3) coverage properties of estimated intervals. An application section demonstrates the method by predicting county-level corn yield using daily weather data from the period 1981-2015, along with parametric time trends representing technological change. The method is shown to out-perform linear methods such as OLS and ridge/lasso, as well as random forest. The procedures described in this paper are implemented in the R package panelNNET.},

            In this paper, we consider the task of predicting the electricity power generated by photovoltaic solar systems for the next day at half‐hourly intervals. We introduce DL, a deep learning approach based on feed‐forward neural networks for big data time series, which decomposes the forecasting problem into several sub‐problems. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using 2 years of Australian solar data, evaluating accuracy and training time, and comparing the performance of DL with two other advanced methods based on neural networks and pattern sequence similarity. We investigate the use of multiple data sources (solar power and weather data for the previous days, and weather forecast for the next day) and also study the effect of different historical window sizes. The results show that DL produces competitive accuracy results and scales well, and is thus a highly suitable method for big data environments.},

	abstract = {With the advent of Big Data, nowadays in many applications databases containing large quantities of similar time series are available. Forecasting time series in these domains with traditional univariate forecasting procedures leaves great potentials for producing accurate forecasts untapped. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have proven recently that they are able to outperform state-of-the-art univariate time series forecasting methods in this context when trained across all available time series. However, if the time series database is heterogeneous, accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards fully automatic forecasting methods in this space, a notion of similarity between the time series needs to be built into the methods. To this end, we present a prediction model that can be used with different types of RNN models on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series clustering techniques. We assess our proposed methodology using LSTM networks, a widely popular RNN variant. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmarking datasets under competition evaluation procedures. In particular, in terms of mean sMAPE accuracy, it consistently outperforms the baseline LSTM model and outperforms all other methods on the CIF2016 forecasting competition dataset.},

	abstract = {Forecasting high-dimensional time series plays a crucial role in many applications such as demand forecasting and financial predictions. Modern datasets can have millions of correlated time-series that evolve together, i.e they are extremely high dimensional (one dimension for each individual time-series). There is a need for exploiting global patterns and coupling them with local calibration for better prediction. However, most recent deep learning approaches in the literature are one-dimensional, i.e, even though they are trained on the whole dataset, during prediction, the future forecast for a single dimension mainly depends on past values from the same dimension. In this paper, we seek to correct this deficiency and propose DeepGLO, a deep forecasting model which thinks globally and acts locally. In particular, DeepGLO is a hybrid model that combines a global matrix factorization model regularized by a temporal convolution network, along with another temporal network that can capture local properties of each time-series and associated covariates. Our model can be trained effectively on high-dimensional but diverse time series, where different time series can have vastly different scales, without a priori normalization or rescaling. Empirical results demonstrate that DeepGLO can outperform state-of-the-art approaches; for example, we see more than 25\% improvement in WAPE over other methods on a public dataset that contains more than 100K-dimensional time series.},

	abstract = {Producing probabilistic forecasts for large collections of similar and/or dependent time series is a practically highly relevant, yet challenging task. Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes, but their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efficient and allows them to provide estimates of uncertainty. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the benefits of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufficient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part and extensive experiments. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model both in term of data efficiency and computational complexity.},

It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships. In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies {\textbackslash}textit\{jointly\} in the {\textbackslash}textit\{spectral domain\}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules. Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/StemGNN/},

	abstract = {The growing use of computers for mechanized inventory control and production planning has brought with it the need for explicit forecasts of sales and usage for individual products and materials. These forecasts must be made on a routine basis for thousands of products, so that they must be made quickly, and, both in terms of computing time and information storage, cheaply; they should be responsive to changing conditions. The paper presents a method of forecasting sales which has these desirable characteristics, and which in terms of ability to forecast compares favorably with other, more traditional methods. Several models of the exponential forecasting system are presented, along with several examples of application.},

	abstract = {We focus on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11\% over a statistical benchmark and by 3\% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in neural forecasting accelerated improvements in the performance of large-scale forecasting systems. Yet, long-horizon forecasting remains a very difficult task. Two common challenges afflicting the task are the volatility of the predictions and their computational complexity. We introduce N-HiTS, a model which addresses both challenges by incorporating novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. These techniques enable the proposed method to assemble its predictions sequentially, emphasizing components with different frequencies and scales while decomposing the input signal and synthesizing the forecast. We prove that the hierarchical interpolation technique can efficiently approximate arbitrarily long horizons in the presence of smoothness. Additionally, we conduct extensive large-scale dataset experiments from the long-horizon forecasting literature, demonstrating the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art methods, where N-HiTS provides an average accuracy improvement of almost 20\% over the latest Transformer architectures while reducing the computation time by an order of magnitude (50 times).

This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99\%, 95\%, and 87\% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.},

	abstract = {Hybrid methods have been shown to outperform pure statistical and pure deep learning methods at forecasting tasks and quantifying the associated uncertainty with those forecasts (prediction intervals). One example is Exponential Smoothing Recurrent Neural Network (ES-RNN), a hybrid between a statistical forecasting model and a recurrent neural network variant. ES-RNN achieves a 9.4{\textbackslash}\% improvement in absolute error in the Makridakis-4 Forecasting Competition. This improvement and similar outperformance from other hybrid models have primarily been demonstrated only on univariate datasets. Difficulties with applying hybrid forecast methods to multivariate data include (\$i\$) the high computational cost involved in hyperparameter tuning for models that are not parsimonious, (\$ii\$) challenges associated with auto-correlation inherent in the data, as well as (\$iii\$) complex dependency (cross-correlation) between the covariates that may be hard to capture. This paper presents Multivariate Exponential Smoothing Long Short Term Memory (MES-LSTM), a generalized multivariate extension to ES-RNN, that overcomes these challenges. MES-LSTM utilizes a vectorized implementation. We test MES-LSTM on several aggregated coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity datasets and find our hybrid approach shows consistent, significant improvement over pure statistical and deep learning methods at forecast accuracy and prediction interval construction.},
