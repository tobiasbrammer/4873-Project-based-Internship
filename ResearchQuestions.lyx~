\begin_layout Subsection*
Financial Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
How Does the Efficient Market Hypothesis Apply to Construction Project Bidding?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Efficient Market Hypothesis posits that all available information is
 already reflected in asset prices.
 You can study whether construction project bids similarly reflect all available
 public and private information about the project’s risk and profitability.
 If not, are there arbitrage opportunities where a well-informed contractor
 can consistently secure profitable projects?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Can the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Be Used to Evaluate the Risk
 and Expected Return of Different Types of Construction Projects?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CAPM is used in finance to determine a theoretically appropriate required
 rate of return of an asset.
 You can explore if a similar framework can determine the 'required rate
 of return' or minimum acceptable profit margin for construction projects,
 given their systematic risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Does the Random Walk Theory Hold for Construction Project Costs and Timelines?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Random Walk Theory suggests that stock price changes are random and cannot
 be predicted.
 You could research whether construction project costs and timelines follow
 a similar random walk, or whether there are predictable patterns that contracto
rs can capitalize on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Applying Portfolio Theory to Construction Project Selection: How Can Firms
 Maximize Returns While Minimizing Risk?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 selection of projects.
 Can a firm optimize its 'portfolio' of construction projects to balance
 risk and return?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
How Do Construction Projects Respond to Market Signals and Information Asymmetry
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Financial markets are strongly influenced by market signals and information
 asymmetry between buyers and sellers.
 In construction projects, there's often a similar asymmetry between clients
 and contractors.
 How does this asymmetry affect project outcomes like delays, cost overruns,
 or legal disputes?
